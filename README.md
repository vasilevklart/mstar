## What is M*?

**M\*** (pronounced *"M-star"*) is a serving system for the new generation of **composite multimodal models** — models built from structurally distinct components (vision encoders, transformer backbones, diffusion and flow heads, audio codecs, action generators, world-model predictors) whose execution path changes with the input and the task.

LLM serving stacks assume inference is a single autoregressive loop. Composite models broke that assumption. M\*'s core idea is the **Walk Graph**: a model is a dataflow graph of its components, and every request is a *Walk* over that graph. A single runtime serves unified multimodal models, omni models, speech LMs, vision-language-action policies, and world models — at or above the performance of engines specialized for each.

**Fast** — per-component fast paths, matched to each component's bottleneck:
- Paged attention (FlashInfer) and continuous batching for autoregressive backbones
- CUDA-graph capture for encoders and decode
- Classifier-free-guidance parallelism for diffusion / flow
- Tensor parallelism and Ulysses sequence parallelism, composable as a TP × SP mesh per component
- Sliding-window chunk streaming for audio codecs
- Component-level disaggregation with pluggable tensor transport (shared memory, TCP, RDMA)

**Flexible** — the abstraction mirrors the model:
- One small Python file per model declares its component graph and its Walks
- A YAML file maps components to GPUs at per-component, per-walk granularity — arbitrary disaggregation, no code changes
- Text, image, audio, video, and robot actions, in and out
- A **Python SDK**, an **OpenAI-compatible API**, and a native streaming endpoint

> **Roadmap.** M\* is evolving toward *many-model, agentic* multimodal serving — routing requests across many models and tools within one graph-scheduled runtime.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e .[all]      # install M*
mstar serve bagel          # one command — launch a server (default: http://localhost:8000)
```

To enable flash-attn support (required for Qwen3-Omni, recommended for BAGEL),
```bash
# torch built for CUDA 12.x (cu12)
uv pip install \
  "https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu12torch2.9cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl"

# torch built for CUDA 13.x (cu13)
uv pip install \
  "https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu13torch2.9cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl"
```

Other models: `mstar serve cosmos3` · `mstar serve cosmos3_droid` · `mstar serve qwen3_omni` · `mstar serve orpheus` · `mstar serve pi05` · `mstar serve vjepa2`

**Python SDK** — works for every model (text, image, audio, video):

```python
from mstar import MStarClient
client = MStarClient("http://localhost:8000")

client.chat("What is the capital of France?").text          # text
client.generate_image("a cat in a hat")                     # → PNG bytes   (BAGEL, Cosmos3)
client.tts("Hello there", voice="tara").to_wav("out.wav")   # → speech      (Orpheus)

for event in client.chat("Tell me a story", stream=True):   # streaming
    print(getattr(event, "text", ""), end="", flush=True)
```

**OpenAI-compatible API** — drop-in for `bagel`, `cosmos3`, `qwen3_omni`, and `orpheus`:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="none")

client.chat.completions.create(model="bagel", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}])
client.audio.speech.create(model="orpheus", input="hi", voice="tara")   # text-to-speech
client.images.generate(model="bagel", prompt="a cat")                   # image generation
```

Runnable scripts and `curl` examples live in [`examples/`](examples/). Power users can launch any
deployment with an explicit config: `mstar-serve --config configs/<model>.yaml`.

_Note_: The **first request(s) on a fresh environment can be slow** — often tens of seconds to a few minutes. mstar ``torch.compile``s the model on first use, and that compilation happens lazily on the first request that exercises each path.

## Supported models

| Model | Family | Input → Output | Endpoints |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| [BAGEL](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT) | Unified multimodal | text, image → text, image | `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/images/generations` |
| [Qwen3-Omni](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct) | Omni | text, image, audio, video → text, speech | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| [Orpheus](https://huggingface.co/canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft) | Speech LM | text → speech | `/v1/audio/speech` |
| [Cosmos3 Nano / Super](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano) | World model | text, image, video → image, video (+ sound), robot actions | `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/videos/generations` |
| [Cosmos3 Policy DROID](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano-Policy-DROID) | Robot policy | text, image, video → robot actions, video | `/generate`, `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/videos/generations` |
| [Pi0.5](https://huggingface.co/lerobot/pi05_base) | Vision-language-action | text, image, state → robot actions | `/generate` |
| [V-JEPA 2 / 2-AC](https://huggingface.co/facebook/vjepa2-vitl-fpc64-256) | World model | video (+ actions) → latents, rollouts | `/generate` |

Every model is reachable through the SDK and the native `/generate` endpoint; the OpenAI-compatible
routes cover the chat, speech, image, and video models.

## How it works

```
HTTP / SDK  →  API Server  →  Conductor  →  Workers (one per GPU)  →  streaming results
                                  │              │
                          walks the graph,   own subgraphs; route tensors
                          schedules walks    directly to one another
```

A model declares a **computation graph** of components and a set of named **Walks** (e.g.
`prefill`, `decode`, `image_gen`). The **Conductor** turns each request into a walk over that graph
and schedules it; **Workers** each own a subgraph on their GPU and stream tensors directly to one
another. Logical graph structure is decoupled from physical placement, so the same model runs
single-GPU or fully disaggregated by changing only the YAML `node_groups`. Four composable
primitives — `Sequential`, `Parallel`, `Loop`, and a cross-partition
`StreamingGraphEdge` — express every model family above. See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.12688) for the full design.

### Optional: Rust ZMQ transport

The ZeroMQ control mesh can run over a Rust transport (vendored in [`rust/`](rust/)) instead of
pyzmq — wire-compatible, selectable per process with `MSTAR_RUST_ZMQ` (default `AUTO`).
Note what AUTO-by-default means: on any machine where the extension is built, the whole
mesh switches to the Rust transport with no configuration change — each process logs its
choice at startup (`control mesh transport: ...`), and `MSTAR_RUST_ZMQ=0` pins pyzmq. Build it with
[maturin](https://www.maturin.rs): `uv pip install maturin && maturin develop --release -m rust/Cargo.toml`.
See the [installation docs](https://m-star.org/mstar/installation.html) and
[environment variables](https://m-star.org/mstar/environment_variables.html).

## Performance

Across every model we benchmark, M\* matches or beats the system specialized for that family — unified
models (BAGEL), omni and speech models (Qwen3-Omni, Orpheus), and world models (Cosmos3, V-JEPA 2) — by executing
only the components each request needs and giving each its own fast path: paged attention and continuous
batching for autoregressive backbones, classifier-free-guidance parallelism for diffusion, chunk streaming
for audio codecs, and persistent-cache loops for world-model rollouts.

Benchmark numbers shift as systems evolve — ours and everyone else's — so rather than freeze figures here
that go stale, we keep the current results and full methodology in the
[blog post](https://m-star.org/) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.12688).
