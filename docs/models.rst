Supported Models
================

``mstar`` ships the following model families. The table below summarizes the registered
families, their registry key (the value of ``model:`` in a config YAML), and a
representative Hugging Face identifier.

Registry keys live in ``mstar/model/registry.py`` (``MODEL_REGISTRY`` / ``HF_MODELS``).

.. list-table:: Registered model families
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 14 34 30

   * - Registry key
     - Example Hugging Face model ID
     - Description
   * - ``bagel``
     - ``ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT``
     - Unified multimodal model (text + image understanding and generation).
   * - ``cosmos3``
     - ``nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano``
     - Cosmos3 world model: t2i/t2v/i2v/v2v diffusion, robot-action modes, opt-in sound.
   * - ``cosmos3_droid``
     - ``nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano-Policy-DROID``
     - Cosmos3 action-policy fine-tune for the DROID platform (``domain_name``
       ``droid_lerobot``, 10-dim raw actions); no sound pathway. The config
       serves the released policy sampling defaults (4 steps, guidance 3.0).
   * - ``cosmos3_super``
     - ``nvidia/Cosmos3-Super``
     - Cosmos3-Super (64B) variant of the above; TP/SP for multi-GPU serving.
   * - ``orpheus``
     - ``canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft``
     - TTS: Llama 3.2 3B LLM emitting audio tokens + SNAC 24 kHz decoder.
   * - ``pi05``
     - ``lerobot/pi05_base``
     - Pi0.5 vision-language-action robotics model (ViT encoder + LLM + flow action expert).
   * - ``qwen3_omni``
     - ``Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct``
     - Omni-modal (text/image/audio/video in, text/audio out): Thinker + Talker + codec.
   * - ``vjepa2``
     - ``facebook/vjepa2-vitl-fpc64-256``
     - V-JEPA 2 video encoder + masked predictor.
   * - ``vjepa2_ac``
     - ``vjepa2-ac-vitg``
     - V-JEPA 2-AC encoder + action-conditioned predictor.
   * - ``whisper_large`` *(Beta)*
     - ``openai/whisper-large-v3``
     - Encoder-decoder ASR (audio in, transcript out). Beta / un-optimized.
   * - ``higgs_audio`` *(Beta)*
     - ``bosonai/higgs-audio-v3-stt``
     - Audio-tower + Qwen3 LLM speech-to-text. Beta / un-optimized.

Notes
-----

- Models marked *(Beta)* are functionally supported but not yet
  performance-optimized; treat their throughput/latency as provisional.
- The IDs above are representative. You may use local paths or compatible variants.
- Some families accept multimodal input (image/audio/video); see the model's
  ``process_prompt`` for the inputs it expects.
- To add a new family, see :doc:`adding_models`.

Cosmos3 environment requirements
--------------------------------

- ``flashinfer`` is required: it is the paged KV/attention backend used by the
  prefill, the captured CUDA graphs, and multi-request batches.
- The default denoise attention backend is ``dense_gen``
  (``Cosmos3Config.attention_backend``), which runs bs=1 eager generation
  attention as one FlashAttention-3 varlen kernel from the ``fa3-fwd`` wheel.
  That wheel is ABI-tied to the installed torch/CUDA build (Hopper builds
  exist for at least torch 2.9 + cu12.8 and torch 2.11 + cu13.0); install the
  one matching your environment. When it is not importable, the engine logs a
  warning at startup and automatically falls back to the paged ``flashinfer``
  backend — serving still works, only the bs=1 dense fast path is lost.
  ``model_kwargs.attention_backend: flashinfer`` in the config YAML selects
  the paged backend explicitly.
- Video-input requests (video-to-video, action inverse-dynamics) decode the
  conditioning clip with ``torchcodec``; environments without it reject those
  requests at preprocessing (other modes are unaffected).
- Generated video containers are written with ``torchcodec``'s ``VideoEncoder``
  when available (torchcodec >= 0.9), otherwise with ``torchvision``'s
  ``write_video``, which needs the PyAV (``av``) package.
- Sound-enabled video responses mux the AAC track with the ``ffmpeg`` and
  ``ffprobe`` binaries, which must be on ``PATH`` (system packages, not
  pip-installable).
- The Wan-VAE decode dtype is gated on the cuDNN build: bf16 needs cuDNN >=
  9.16 (fast Hopper bf16 conv3d); older cuDNN serves the decode in fp32/TF32
  automatically.
